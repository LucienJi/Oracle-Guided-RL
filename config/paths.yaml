# @package _global_
# Global path configuration
# This file defines the project root directory
# 
# Usage in config files:
#   defaults:
#     - /paths
#     - ...
#   oracle_0: '${paths.project_root}/checkpoints/...'
#
# To override for your cluster:
# 1. Run: bash setup_paths.sh (recommended - creates paths_local.yaml)
# 2. Or set environment variable: export ORACLES_PROJECT_ROOT=/your/path
# 3. Or manually create config/paths_local.yaml with: project_root: /your/path

# Project root directory
# Priority: paths_local.project_root > ORACLES_PROJECT_ROOT env var > current working directory
# Note: paths_local.yaml is gitignored and created by setup_paths.sh
project_root: ${oc.env:ORACLES_PROJECT_ROOT,${hydra:runtime.cwd}}
